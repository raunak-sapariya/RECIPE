            Light and airy yet rich, this is a Chocolate Mousse made the classic French way, as served in fine dining restaurants. 
            Less cream, richer mouth feel, true chocolate flavour. It's actually quite straight forward to make!

                <li>
                    For reliable results, work at a steady pace so your whipped egg whites and cream do not get too warm!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separate eggs and yolks while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. 
                    Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Yolks: Whisk yolks until uniform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt chocolate and butter: Break chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-proof bowl with the butter. 
                    Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. (Stir in optional flavourings at 
                    this point, but read Note 6 first). Set aside to cool slightly while you proceed with other steps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whip cream: Beat cream until stiff peaks form, being careful not to over-whip
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whip whites: Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold egg yolks into cream using a rubber spatula - 8 folds max. Some streaks is fine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check chocolate temperature: The chocolate should still be runny but warm (min 35C / 95F; ideal 40C / 104F). 
                    If too cool or thick, microwave in burst of 5 seconds at a time until runny.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour chocolate into cream yolk mixture. Fold through – 8 folds max. Some streaks here are ok.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add 1/4 of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold through until incorporated – "smear" the spatular 
                    across surface to blend white lumps in – aim for 10 folds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Fold through until incorporated and no more white lumps remain –
                    aim for 12 folds max, but ensure there are no obvious egg white patches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide mixture between 4 small glasses or pots. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To serve, garnish with cream and chocolate shavings. Raspberries and a tiny sprig of mint for colour would also be lovely!
